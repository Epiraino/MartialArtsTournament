##Overview
The Martial Arts Tournament Management System is a web-based application that allows administrators to manage martial arts tournaments, including fighter registration, match scheduling, and bracket generation. The system should be built using Java Spring Boot and deployed to a cloud-based platform such as AWS.

###Features
User Registration and Login: Users can register for an account and log in to access the system's features.
Tournament Creation: An administrator can create a new tournament and set up divisions based on weight classes, belt ranks, or age groups.
Fighter Registration: Fighters can register for the tournament and provide their personal information such as name, age, weight, belt rank, and contact information.
Bracket Generation: The system should automatically generate brackets for each division based on the fighters' attributes.
Match Scheduling: Administrators can schedule matches for each bracket, assigning referees and time slots.
Match Scoring: Referees can enter the scores for each match, and the system should update the brackets and display the results on the website.
Live Stream: The system should allow for live streaming of the tournament matches to be viewed by spectators who can't attend the tournament in person.
Analytics: The system should provide analytics on the tournament's overall performance, including the number of fighters registered, the number of matches completed, the winners, and any statistical insights available.

##Architecture
The system should be built using the following technologies:

Java Spring Boot: For the backend logic and database interaction.
MySQL: For data storage and retrieval.
ReactJS: For the frontend interface.
WebSockets: For live streaming and real-time updates.
The system should have a three-tier architecture with the following layers:

Presentation Layer: The ReactJS frontend interface that communicates with the backend API using RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
Application Layer: The Java Spring Boot backend logic that handles authentication, registration, scheduling, scoring, and analytics.
Data Access Layer: The MySQL database that stores the application data.

###UserStories

* As a tournament administrator, I want to create a new tournament with a name, location, date, and rules so that I can manage the event.

* As a tournament administrator, I want to create divisions within a tournament based on weight class, belt rank, or age group to organize the competitors.

* As a fighter, I want to register for an account with my name, email, and password so that I can access the system and sign up for tournaments. 

* As a fighter, I want to register for a specific tournament and provide my personal information, including name, age, weight, belt rank, and contact information, so that I can participate in the event.

* As a referee, I want to register for an account with my name, email, password, certification level, and contact information so that I can officiate matches during the tournament.

* As a tournament administrator, I want to automatically generate brackets for each division based on the fighters' attributes so that the matches are organized fairly.

* As a tournament administrator, I want to schedule matches for each bracket, assigning referees and time slots so that the tournament runs smoothly.

* As a referee, I want to enter scores for each match and have the system automatically update the brackets and display the results on the website so that participants and spectators can see the outcomes.

* As a spectator, I want to view live streams of the tournament matches if I can't attend the event in person so that I can still enjoy the competition.

* As a tournament administrator, I want to access analytics about the tournament, including the number of fighters registered, the number of matches completed, the winners, and any statistical insights available so that I can track the event's success and plan for future events.

* As a user, I want to log in and out of the system securely with my email and password so that I can access my account and manage my participation in the tournament.
  

needs PUML
* As a tournament administrator, I want to manage access levels for different user roles, such as administrators and referees, so that users can perform their respective tasks without compromising the system's integrity.

* As a fighter, I want to view my upcoming matches and results so that I can track my progress throughout the tournament.

* As a referee, I want to see a list of my assigned matches and their time slots so that I can plan my schedule accordingly.

* As a spectator, I want to view the brackets and match results for each division so that I can follow the competition and see how the fighters are progressing.

###Security
The system should implement the following security measures:

Password Encryption: User passwords should be encrypted using a secure algorithm such as bcrypt.
Authentication: Users should be required to log in with their email and password to access the system's features.
Authorization: The system should have role-based access control, with different roles such as administrator and referee having different levels of access.
HTTPS: The system should use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the client and the server.

###Deployment
The system should be deployed to a cloud-based platform such as AWS using the following architecture:

Amazon EC2: For hosting the Java Spring Boot backend API and the MySQL database.
Amazon S3: For storing the live streaming video files.
Amazon CloudFront: For delivering the live streaming video content to the clients.
Amazon Route 53: For managing the DNS records and routing traffic to the correct resources.
Conclusion
The Martial Arts Tournament Management System is a comprehensive system for managing martial arts tournaments, from fighter registration to match scheduling and analytics. The system should be built using Java Spring Boot, postgres, Thymeleaf and Bootstraps and growth within the martial arts community.
