This diagram illustrates the process of a tournament administrator accessing analytics about the tournament. The
administrator accesses the tournament analytics page on the web interface, which requests the tournament analytics data
from the backend API. The API retrieves the analytics data from the database and sends it back to the web interface,
which displays the tournament analytics, including the number of fighters registered, the number of matches completed,
the winners, and any statistical insights available. The web interface then shows the analytics data to the administrator.
