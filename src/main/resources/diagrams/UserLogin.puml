This diagram illustrates the process of a user logging in and out of the system securely with their email and password.
The user enters their email and password on the web interface, which sends a login request to the backend API. The API
verifies the user's credentials in the database and returns an authentication status. If successful, the user is shown
their account dashboard; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

When the user wants to log out, they click on the logout button, and the web interface sends a logout request to the
backend API. The API invalidates the user's session, and the web interface redirects the user to the login page.
