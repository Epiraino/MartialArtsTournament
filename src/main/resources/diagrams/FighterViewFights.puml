This diagram illustrates the process of a fighter viewing their upcoming matches and results throughout the tournament.
The fighter accesses their profile page on the web interface, which requests their upcoming matches and results from the
backend API. The API retrieves the match and result data for the fighter from the database and returns the information
to the web interface, which then displays the upcoming matches and results to the fighter.
