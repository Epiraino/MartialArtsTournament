This diagram illustrates the process of a referee viewing a list of their assigned matches and time slots. The referee
accesses their profile page on the web interface, which requests their assigned matches and time slots from the backend
API. The API retrieves the match and time slot data for the referee from the database and returns the information to the
web interface, which then displays the list of assigned matches and time slots to the referee.
