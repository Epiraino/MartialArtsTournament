This diagram illustrates the process of a spectator viewing the brackets and match results for each division. The
spectator accesses the tournament page on the web interface, which requests the brackets and match results for each
division from the backend API. The API retrieves the bracket and match result data from the database and returns the
information to the web interface, which then displays the brackets and match results for each division to the spectator.
